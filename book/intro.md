## Chapter 1: Basics of Probability

In this chapter, we will cover the foundational concepts of probability, including sample spaces, events, and basic probability rules.

## Chapter 2: Conditional Probability

Here, we'll explore the concept of conditional probability, Bayes' Theorem, and independence between events.

## Chapter 3: Random Variables

This chapter introduces random variables, both discrete and continuous, and their properties.

## Chapter 4: Probability Distributions

We will study different probability distributions and their applications in real-world scenarios.

## Chapter 5: Expectation and Variance

Learn how to calculate the expected value and variance of random variables and their significance.

## Chapter 6: Common Probability Distributions

This chapter dives into commonly used probability distributions, such as the Binomial, Poisson, and Normal distributions.

## Chapter 7: Law of Large Numbers

Understand the Law of Large Numbers and how it relates to the behavior of averages in probability.

## Chapter 8: Central Limit Theorem

We will cover the Central Limit Theorem and its crucial role in statistics.
